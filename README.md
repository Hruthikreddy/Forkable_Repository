# Chapter-4 Forkable_Repository
This repository is designed to help you learn how to fork a repository on GitHub and create your own personalized version.
## What is forking?
Forking is a fundamental concept in Git and GitHub that allows you to create a copy of a repository under your GitHub account. This copy, known as a "fork," enables you to freely experiment and make changes without affecting the original repository.

## How to use this repository

To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. **Fork this repository:** Click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of this page. This action will create a copy of this repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the repository:** Once you have forked the repository, navigate to your GitHub account and locate the forked repository and clone it.

3. **Make changes:** Now that you have cloned the repository to your local machine, feel free to make any changes you want. Experiment with modifying existing files, creating new ones, or customizing the project according to your preferences.

4. **Commit and push your changes:** After making the desired changes, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository
